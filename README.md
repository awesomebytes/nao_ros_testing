nao_ros_testing
===============

Package that contains the work done on using Nao over ROS.


In dae_bodyparts you'll find meshes (in .dae format) of the parts of the Nao to have a prettier simulation using the urdfs you can find in urdf_nao_textured.

It won't work out of the box because of hardcoded paths in the urdfs.


This is thought to be used with the ROS nao packages http://www.ros.org/wiki/nao_robot

The bodyparts look like this: http://i.imgur.com/ac9JW.jpg

And the model loaded looks like this: http://i.imgur.com/Xjgby.png
